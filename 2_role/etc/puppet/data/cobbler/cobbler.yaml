# By default new nodes added to cobbler are set to PXE boot
# automatically into the Ubuntu installer. Once the install completes
# successfully, Cobbler will disable PXE booting into the installer
# for that node.
#
# You can override this automatic behavior on a per-node basis, as
# in the commented-out example for the build server below:
# netboot_enabled: "0"
# will tell Cobbler to not PXE boot install the server.
# netboot_enabled: "1"
# will tell Cobbler to PXE boot install the server at every boot.
# If present in the node definition, the netboot_enabled parameter is
# applied for that node on every Puppet run on the build server. If not
# present for a node, Puppet runs on the build server will not change
# whatever existing value is currently set in Cobbler for that node.
